# web-scraping-challenge


Welcome to my Web-Scraping Challenge!  

This activity was simple to understand and utilize. It was amazing to see how easily we could use Python to scrape data from a webpage.  Learning about CSS tags and the various parts of a webpage was important and really helped make using Beautiful Soup easier.

The second part of the activity was interesting because it blended together things that we had learned in previous modules. I can see how important it is to learn when in the field of data analytics.

Thank you for looking at my work!
